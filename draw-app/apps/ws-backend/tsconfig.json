// we could have done npm tsc init -y in both the ws and http backend folders in tscconfig.json folder
//  but it would have been the same code so using the monorepo thing 

// we have the packages in the packages folder inside it is  the tsconfig thing and we need the base.json folder for our use
// so we just import it from there 

// we need to import @repo/typescript-config/ as a dependency to use in our folder so we will introduce it in the package.json
// folder as a dependency
